# PlanetsLib

Code and graphics to help modders creating planets and moons, plus thoughtful
standardizations to avoid mod proliferations (such as
[Surfaces Have Temperature](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Surfaces-Have-Temperature))
each time we want to standardize something.

This library is fully open-source and will grow over time â€” feel free to
contribute via pull requests on
[Github](https://github.com/danielmartin0/PlanetsLib).

## Features

* `PlanetsLib:planet_extend({...` defines the orbit of planets with respect to another body.
* If a technology `[planet-name]-cargo-drops` is defined, players will be unable to drop cargo (excluding players and construction robots) to that planet before researching that technology. The functionality is implemented automatically. `PlanetsLib.technology_icons_planet_cargo_drops` and `PlanetsLib.technology_effect_cargo_drops` are provided for easy construction of the technology prototype.
* Extra support for moons:
    * `PlanetsLib.technology_icons_moon` is used to create icons for moon discovery.
    * A new row is available in Factoriopedia for moons.
* `PlanetLib:borrow_music(source_planet, target_planet)` clone music tracks from an existing planet.
* New surface condition 'temperature' with default values as below.

## Base game planet temperatures

These values are spaced out to enable modded planets to slot in-between.

| Surface         | Temperature (K) |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Nauvis          | 288K            |
| Vulcanus        | 332K            |
| Fulgora         | 314K            |
| Gleba           | 298K            |
| Aquilo          | 258K            |
| Space Platforms | 268K            |
| Default         | 288K            |
